        <h1 class="title">How to Use the App: A Quick Guide</h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Welcome to Dr. Me, your personalized climate and comfort assistant! Follow these simple steps to make the most of our app:</p>
        <div class="wrapper">
            <div class="quickGuide">
                <h2>Navigation:</h2>
                <p>Access the app's main navigation menu by clicking the hamburger menu icon (â˜°) located at the top left corner of the screen.
                The navigation menu provides easy access to essential sections, including "Quick Guide," "Main app", "Contact," and "Settings."</p>    
                <h2>Entering Location and Foods:</h2>
                <p>Begin by entering your city name in the "Enter city name" field. This will help us tailor our recommendations to your local climate.<br>
                To help our App make a better diagnosis, try to go to places with different climate conditions in order to test all options, if you stay in one city, we may not be able to pin point the problem accurately and you will get a more "general" response. Also, if you happen to be traveling outside of your city, don't forget to enter the name of that city and not the city where you live.<br>
                Under the "Enter foods" field, enter all the foods you had that day divided by a comma, no "and" or "with", if you had a hamburger sandwich, write:</p>
                <div class="foodExample">bread, hamburger, lettuce, tomatoes, mayonaise</div> <br> <p>etc... Also, be consistent in your naming of foods, for example: if you eat french fries one day, don't call it fries, instead, call it potatoes so that if another day you eat potatoes then the App will count them both when diagnosing.
                Don't forget to indicate whether you're feeling discomfort today by checking the checkbox provided under "Are you feeling any discomfort today?"</p>    
                <h2>Getting Your Chart:</h2>
                <p>After entering your preferences, click the "Get Chart" button to generate a personalized climate and food comfort chart. The chart will save the different combinations of climate conditions and foods based on your inputs, along with the experienced discomfort levels associated with them.</p>    
                <h2>Interpreting the Chart:</h2>
                <p>The chart presents various climate conditions, such as humidity, temperature, and pressure, along with discomfort levels.
                Conditions with higher discomfort levels are highlighted, helping you identify potential triggers for discomfort.
                Common factors contributing to discomfort will be identified if applicable.</p> 
                <h2>Viewing Diagnosis:</h2>
                <p>After 21 days of entering your data, the "View Diagnosis" button will appear. Click it to view a detailed diagnosis based on your inputs and the chart's data.</p>   
                <h2>Important Tips:</h2>
                <p>Don't miss the "Important tip!" section at the bottom of the main screen, which provides valuable insights on how to enter information that will help us give you a more accurate diagnose.</p>
